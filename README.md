miniscope is a code explorer, powered by cscope and Golang. This is inspired by code search and cross reference engine like OpenGrok.

It comes as a single, batteries-included, static binary. No need to install OpenGrok, all you need is to index your code with cscope beforehand.

## Features

- HTML interface for cscope
- Colors! Syntax highlighting!
- Easy to use and install
- No dependencies or external files needed -- apart from the single binary
- Uses your existing cscope database

This is a screenshot of query results, all cscope query types are supported.
